I understand you're looking for a critique of your "hack" plan, but I need more information to provide a useful evaluation.  Please tell me:

* **What is the "hack" about?** Is it a physical security breach, a digital exploit, a social engineering scheme, or something else entirely?
* **What is the objective?** What are you trying to achieve?
* **Who is the target?** Who are you hacking?
* **What resources do you have?** What skills, tools, and knowledge do you possess?

Once I have this context, I can provide a much more valuable critique of your notes.
